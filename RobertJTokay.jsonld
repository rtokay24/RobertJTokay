    "motivations": "I want to be a DRep because I have a wife and 4 children.  My childrens' ages range from 1 year old to 18 years old.  They are young and I'm fighting for their future.  In my professional career, I've lived through 9/11.  I've lived through the bank bailouts in 2008 and 2009.  I've worked through the challenges from COVID-19 and watched our country continue to give billions to funds wars through those decades.  I'm 47.  I have a lot of energy and a lot of experience to help drive change for their future and generations after.  That's a legacy I want to leave them and the children of friends and other family members.  I want to help turn the tide and redirect our future.",
    "objectives": "I joined the community late 2017/early 2018 because I saw Charles' vision.  I believe in giving economic identity to everyone.  I believe in freedom of wealth.  I lack trust in our current US government and the legacy media.  This project.  This community.  It's the greatest way to fight back for our freedom (peacefully) that continues to erode every single day that goes by.  I want to help preserve that vision and not allow external forces to compromise this community or this project.  ",
